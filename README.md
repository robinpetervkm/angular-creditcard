#Forms In General

1. Created by grouping together a series pf inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, selects, etc
2. Froms need validation
3. Froms need messaging to help the user along
4. Forms frequently need to change rapidly without having to rewrite a ton of app logic
5. Angular has two seperate and differrent systems for building forms
6. We can technically implement forms with just what we have covered in this course so far(propetry binding and event handlers)
